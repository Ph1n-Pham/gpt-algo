# ðŸ¤–ðŸ“š Data Structure and Algorithm Education Bot

This is a learning bot designed to help students understand and practice data structures and algorithms. The bot is built using Langchain, OpenAI, and Streamlit. It provides an interactive environment where students can learn, experiment, and receive guidance on various concepts related to data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- **Interactive Learning**: The bot provides a user-friendly interface to interact with students and guide them through different data structure and algorithm topics.

- **Concept Explanation**: The bot offers explanations and examples for various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and algorithms such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal.

- **Practice questions**: The bot provides quizzes and problems to help you review the material.
<!--
- **Problem Solving**: The bot offers practice problems of varying difficulty levels to help students apply their knowledge and enhance problem-solving skills.

- **Guided Assistance**: The bot assists students in solving problems by providing hints, step-by-step guidance, and suggestions for improvement.

- **Performance Analysis**: The bot can evaluate the efficiency of algorithms and help students understand the time and space complexity of different approaches.

- **Learning Resources**: The bot provides links to external resources, tutorials, and additional learning materials for in-depth understanding and further exploration.
